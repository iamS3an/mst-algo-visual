# Algorithm Visualization

## 📌 Overview
A **web-based tool** for visualizing algorithm execution **step by step**. It helps learners understand algorithms through **interactive animations and user inputs**.

## 🎯 Motivation
- **Easier Learning**: Visualizing execution makes understanding algorithms simpler.  
- **Better Than Static Methods**: Most resources use **pseudocode** or **non-interactive diagrams**.  
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Interactive steps make it easier to follow complex operations.  

## 🏛️ Background
- **Traditional teaching is theoretical** and lacks visualization.  
- **Debugging algorithms is challenging** without interactive tools.  
- **Existing tools are limited** in interactivity and ease of use.  

## 🔥 Features
✅ **Web-Based** – No installation needed.  
✅ **Step-by-Step Execution** – Visualizes **graphs & animations**.  
✅ **User Interaction** – Modify inputs & adjust parameters.  

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Focus on **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms**.  
2. Research existing applications to improve uniqueness.  
3. Choose the best tools & frameworks for implementation.  

## ⚡ Challenges
- **Making the interface intuitive** compared to existing solutions.  
- **Proving its effectiveness** in improving algorithm learning.
